 To undo the changes introduced by a specific commit with the ID "abc123" in Git, you can
 use the git revert command. The git revert command creates a new commit that undoes the
 changes made by the specified commit, effectively "reverting" the commit.
 Here's the command:
 $ git revert abc123
 Replace "abc123" with the actual commit ID that you want to revert. After running this
 command, Git will create a new commit that negates the changes introduced by the specified
 commit. This is a safe way to undo changes in Git because it preserves the commit history
 and creates a new commit to record the reversal of the changes.
