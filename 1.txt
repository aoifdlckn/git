 $ git init

 Create a new file in the directory. For example, let's create a file named "my_file.txt."
 You can use any text editor or command-line tools to create the file.
 Add the newly created file to the staging area. Replace "my_file.txt" with the actual
 name of your file:

 $ git add my_file.txt

 This command stages the file for the upcoming commit.

 $ git commit -m "Your commit message here"
 Your commit message should briefly describe the purpose or nature of the changes you made.For example:
 $ git commit -m "Add a new file called my_file.txt"
 After these steps, your changes will be committed to the Git repository with the provided commit message.
 You nowhave a version of the repository with the new file and its history stored in Git
