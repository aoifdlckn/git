 To merge the "feature-branch" into "master" in Git while providing a custom commit message for the
 merge, you can use the following command:
 $ git checkout master
 $ git merge feature-branch -m "Your custom commit message here"
 Replace "Your custom commit message here" with a meaningful and descriptive commit message for
 the merge. This message will be associated with the merge commit that is created when you merge
 "feature-branch" into "master.
