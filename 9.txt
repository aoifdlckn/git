 To view the details of a specific commit, including the author, date, and commit message,
 you can use the git show or git log command with the commit ID. Here are both options:
 1.
 Using git show:
 bash
 git show <commit-ID>
 Replace <commit-ID> with the actual commit ID you want to view. This command will
 display detailed information about the specified commit, including the commit message,
 author, date, and the changes introduced by that commit

  For example:
 $ git show abc123
 1.
 Using git log:
 $ git log-n 1 <commit-ID>
 The-n 1 option tells Git to show only one commit. Replace <commit-ID> with the actual commit
 ID. This command will display a condensed view of the specified commit, including its commit
 message, author, date, and commit ID.

  For example:
 $ git log-n 1 abc123
 Both of these commands will provide you with the necessary information about
 the specific commit you're interested in
