To create a lightweight Git tag named "v1.0" for a commit in your local repository, you can use the
 following command:
 $ git tag v1.0
 This command will create a lightweight tag called "v1.0" for the most recent commit in your current
 branch. If you want to tag a specific commit other than the most recent one, you can specify the
 commit's SHA-1 hash after the tag name. For example:
 $ git tag v1.0 <commit-SHA>
 Replace <commit-SHA> with the actual SHA-1 hash of the commit you want to tag
