 Open your terminal or command prompt.
 Make sure you are in the local branch that you want to rebase. You
 can switch to the branch using the following command, replacing
 <branch-name> with your actual branch name:
 $ git checkout <branch-name>

  1.
 Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository. This will update your local
 repository with the changes from the remote without merging them into your local
 branch:
 $ git fetch origin
 Here, origin is the default name for the remote repository. If you have multiple remotes,
 replace origin with the name of the specific remote you want to fetch from

  1.
 Once you have fetched the latest changes, rebase your local branch onto the updated remote
 branch:
 $ git rebase origin/<branch-name>
 Replace <branch-name> with the name of the remote branch you want to rebase onto. This
 command will reapply your local commits on top of the latest changes from the remote branch,
 effectively incorporating the remote changes into your branch history.

  1.
 Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the rebase process. Git will
 stop and notify you if there are conflicts that need to be resolved. Use
 a text editor to edit the conflicting files, save the changes, and then
 continue the rebase with:
 $ git rebase--continue

 2.
 After resolving any conflicts and completing the rebase, you have successfully updated your local branch
 with the latest changes from the remote branch.
 If you want to push your rebased changes to the remote repository, use the git push command. However, be
 cautious when pushing to a shared remote branch, as it can potentially overwrite other developers' changes:
 $ git push origin <branch-name>
 Replace <branch-name> with the name of your local branch.By following these steps, you can keep your
 local branch up to date with the latest changes from the remote repository and maintain a clean and linear
 history through rebasing
