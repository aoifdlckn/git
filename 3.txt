 Creating and Managing Branches:
 Write the commands to stash your changes, switch branches, and then apply the stashedchanges.
 Solution:
 To stash your changes, switch branches, and then apply the stashed changes in Git, you canuse the
 following commands:
 1.
 Stash your changes:
 $ git stash save "Your stash message"
 This command will save your changes in a stash, which acts like a temporary storage forchanges that 
are not ready to be committed.
 1.
 1.
 Switch to the desired branch:
 $ git checkout target-branch
 Replace "target-branch" with the name of the branch you want to switch to.
 Apply the stashed changes:
 $ git stash apply
 This command will apply the most recent stash to your current working branch. If you have multiple
 stashes, you can specify a stash by name or reference (e.g., git stash apply stash@{2}) if needed.
 If you want to remove the stash after applying it, you can use git stash pop instead of git stashapply.
 Remember to replace "Your stash message" and "target-branch" with the actual message you want for your 
stash and the name of the branch you want to switch to
