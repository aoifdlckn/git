 To display the last five commits in a Git repository's history, you can use the git
 log command with the-n option, which limits the number of displayed commits.
 Here's the command:
 $ git log-n 5
 This command will show the last five commits in the repository's history. You
 can adjust the number after-n to display a different number of commits if
 needed
